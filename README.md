## Take-home Data Exercise from the Impact Fellowship

This project was completed as a part of the application process for the Education Pioneers Data Impact Fellowship: https://www.educationpioneers.org/what-we-do/education-pioneers-fellowships/impact-fellowship

# I cleaned the data using the Pandas library and queried the database using SQL query languange. I answered the following questions:

-- How did the pilot school 5th graders’ ELA mean scores compare to the non-pilot 5th graders in 2017 (2016 - 2017 school year)? 

-- Which pilot school exhibited the most growth in ELA mean scale scores from the 2016 test through the 2017 test?

-- What is the percentage difference in this school’s 5th grade growth from 2016 through 2017 compared to the other pilot schools’ 5th grade average growth during the same time period?

-- What was the average percentage of students who received free/reduced lunch in the 5 pilot schools in 2017?

-- What was the average ELA mean test score of the non-pilot schools that have an equal or greater percentage of students who qualify for free/reduced lunch as the pilot schools? Please only look at the 5th grade class in the 2017 school year.
